These two events resulted in two very unique products, a natural mineral salt with the wholesome minerals from that pristine, unpolluted ocean captured within the crystallization of the salt, and a volcanic ash rich in the myriad of natural minerals usually only found deep within Mother Earth. Redmond Minerals simply extracts this unique blend of natural performance enhancing minerals from their pristine environment and makes them available to horse owners around the world. Many horse breeders report remarkable benefits to their horses from feeding these ancient natural minerals.</div>
